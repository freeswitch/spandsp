/*! \page v27ter_tx_page The V.27ter transmitter
\section v27ter_tx_page_sec_1 What does it do?
The V.27ter transmitter implements the transmit side of a V.27ter modem. This
can operate at data rates of 4800 and 2400 bits/s. The audio output is a stream
of 16 bit samples, at 8000 samples/second. The transmit and receive side of
V.27ter modems operate independantly. V.27ter is used for FAX transmission,
where it provides the standard 4800 and 2400 bits/s rates.

\section v27ter_tx_page_sec_2 How does it work?
V.27ter uses DPSK modulation. A common method of producing a DPSK modulated
signal is to use a sampling rate which is a multiple of the baud rate. The raw
signal is then a series of complex pulses, each an integer number of samples
long. These can be shaped, using a suitable complex filter, and multiplied by a
complex carrier signal to produce the final DPSK signal for transmission.

The pulse shaping filter for V.27ter is defined in the spec. It is a root raised
cosine filter with 50% excess bandwidth.

The sampling rate for our transmitter is defined by the channel - 8000 samples/s.
This is a multiple of the baud rate at 4800 bits/s (8-PSK at 1600 baud, 5 samples per
symbol), but not at 2400 bits/s (4-PSK at 1200 baud, 20/3 samples per symbol). The baud
interval is actually 20/3 sample periods at 2400bis/s. A symmetric FIR is used to
apply root raised cosine filtering in the 4800bits/s mode. In the 2400bits/s mode
a polyphase FIR filter is used. This consists of 20 sets of coefficients, offering
zero to 19/20ths of a baud phase shift as well as root raised cosine filtering.
The appropriate coefficient set is chosen for each signal sample generated.

The carrier is generated using the DDS method. Using 2 second order resonators,
started in quadrature, might be more efficient, as it would have less impact on
the processor cache than a table lookup approach. However, the DDS approach
suits the receiver better, so then same signal generator is also used for the
transmitter.
