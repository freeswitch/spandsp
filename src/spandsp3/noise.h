/*! \page noise_page Noise generation

\section noise_page_sec_1 What does it do?
It generates audio noise. Currently it only generates reasonable quality
AWGN. It is designed to be of sufficiently low complexity to generate large
volumes of reasonable quality noise, in real time.

Hoth noise is used to model indoor ambient noise when evaluating communications
systems such as telephones. It is named after D.F. Hoth, who made the first
systematic study of this. The official definition of Hoth noise is IEEE
standard 269-2001 (revised from 269-1992), "Draft Standard Methods for Measuring
Transmission Performance of Analog and Digital Telephone Sets, Handsets and Headsets."

The table below gives the spectral density of Hoth noise, adjusted in level to produce
a reading of 50 dBA.

\section awgn_page_sec_2 How does it work?
The central limit theorem says if you add a few random numbers together,
the result starts to look Gaussian. In this case we sum 8 random numbers.
The result is fast, and perfectly good as a noise source for many purposes.
It should not be trusted as a high quality AWGN generator, for elaborate
modelling purposes.
