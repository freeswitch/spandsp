\section modem_connect_tones_page_sec_1 What does it do?
Some telephony terminal equipment, such as modems, require a channel which is as
clear as possible. They use their own echo cancellation. If the network is also
performing echo cancellation the two cancellors can end up squabbling about the
nature of the channel, with bad results. A special tone is defined which should
cause the network to disable any echo cancellation processes. This is the echo
canceller disable tone.

The tone detector's design assumes the channel is free of any DC component.

\section modem_connect_tones_page_sec_2 How does it work?
A sharp notch filter is implemented as a single bi-quad section. The presence of
the 2100Hz disable tone is detected by comparing the notched filtered energy
with the unfiltered energy. If the notch filtered energy is much lower than the
unfiltered energy, then a large proportion of the energy must be at the notch
frequency. This type of detector may seem less intuitive than using a narrow
bandpass filter to isolate the energy at the notch freqency. However, a sharp
bandpass implemented as an IIR filter rings badly. The reciprocal notch filter
is very well behaved for our purpose.
