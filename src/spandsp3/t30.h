\section t30_page_sec_1 What does it do?
The T.30 protocol is the core protocol used for FAX transmission. This module
implements most of its key features. It does not interface to the outside world.
Seperate modules do that for T.38, analogue line, and other forms of FAX
communication.

Current features of this module include:

    - FAXing to and from multi-page TIFF/F files, whose images are one of the standard
      FAX sizes.
    - V.27ter, V.29 and V.17 modes (2400bps, to 14,400bps).
    - T.4 1D (MH), T.4 2D,(MR) and T.6 (MMR) compression.
    - Error correction mode (ECM).
    - All standard horizonal resolutions (R8, R16, 300dpi, 600dpi, 800dpi, 1200dpi).
    - All standard vertical resolutions (standard, fine, superfine, 300dpi, 600dpi, 800dpi, 1200dpi).
    - All standard page widths (A4, B4, A3).
    - All standard page lengths (A4, B4, North American letter, North American legal, continuous).
    - Monitoring and sending identifier strings (CSI, TSI, and CIG).
    - Monitoring and sending sub-address strings (SUB).
    - Monitoring and sending polling sub-addresses (SEP).
    - Monitoring and sending polled sub-addresses (PSA).
    - Monitoring and sending sender identifications (SID).
    - Monitoring and sending passwords (PWD).
    - Monitoring of non-standard facility frames (NSF, NSC, and NSS).
    - Sending custom non-standard facility frames (NSF, NSC, and NSS).
    - Analogue modem and T.38 operation.

\section t30_page_sec_2 How does it work?

Some of the following is paraphrased from some notes found a while ago on the Internet.
I cannot remember exactly where they came from, but they are useful.

\subsection t30_page_sec_2a The answer (CED) tone

The T.30 standard says an answering fax device must send CED (a 2100Hz tone) for
approximately 3 seconds before sending the first handshake message. Some machines
send an 1100Hz or 1850Hz tone, and some send no tone at all. In fact, this answer
tone is so unpredictable, it cannot really be used. It should, however, always be
generated according to the specification.

\subsection t30_page_sec_2b Common Timing Deviations

The T.30 spec. specifies a number of time-outs. For example, after dialing a number,
a calling fax system should listen for a response for 35 seconds before giving up.
These time-out periods are as follows:

    - T1 - 35+-5s: the maximum time for which two fax system will attempt to identify each other
    - T2 - 6+-1s:  a time-out used to start the sequence for changing transmit parameters
    - T3 - 10+-5s: a time-out used in handling operator interrupts
    - T5 - 60+-5s: a time-out used in error correction mode

These time-outs are sometimes misinterpreted. In addition, they are routinely
ignored, sometimes with good reason. For example, after placing a call, the
calling fax system is supposed to wait for 35 seconds before giving up. If the
answering unit does not answer on the first ring or if a voice answering machine
is connected to the line, or if there are many delays through the network,
the delay before answer can be much longer than 35 seconds.

Fax units that support error correction mode (ECM) can respond to a post-image
handshake message with a receiver not ready (RNR) message. The calling unit then
queries the receiving fax unit with a receiver ready (RR) message. If the
answering unit is still busy (printing for example), it will repeat the RNR
message. According to the T.30 standard, this sequence (RR/RNR RR/RNR) can be
repeated for up to the end of T5 (60+-5s). However, many fax systems
ignore the time-out and will continue the sequence indefinitely, unless the user
manually overrides.

All the time-outs are subject to alteration, and sometimes misuse. Good T.30
implementations must do the right thing, and tolerate others doing the wrong thing.

\subsection t30_page_sec_2c Variations in the inter-carrier gap

T.30 specifies 75+-20ms of silence between signals using different modulation
schemes. Examples are between the end of a DCS signal and the start of a TCF signal,
and between the end of an image and the start of a post-image signal. Many fax systems
violate this requirement, especially for the silent period between DCS and TCF.
This may be stretched to well over 100ms. If this period is too long, it can interfere with
handshake signal error recovery, should a packet be corrupted on the line. Systems
should ensure they stay within the prescribed T.30 limits, and be tolerant of others
being out of spec..

\subsection t30_page_sec_2d Other timing variations

Testing is required to determine the ability of a fax system to handle
variations in the duration of pauses between unacknowledged handshake message
repetitions, and also in the pauses between the receipt of a handshake command and
the start of a response to that command. In order to reduce the total
transmission time, many fax systems start sending a response message before the
end of the command has been received.

\subsection t30_page_sec_2e Other deviations from the T.30 standard

There are many other commonly encountered variations between machines, including:

    - frame sequence deviations
    - preamble and flag sequence variations
    - improper EOM usage
    - unusual data rate fallback sequences
    - common training pattern detection algorithms
    - image transmission deviations
    - use of the talker echo protect tone
    - image padding and short lines
    - RTP/RTN handshake message usage
    - long duration lines
    - nonstandard disconnect sequences
    - DCN usage
