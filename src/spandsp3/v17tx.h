/*! \page v17tx_page The V.17 transmitter
\section v17tx_page_sec_1 What does it do?
The V.17 transmitter implements the transmit side of a V.17 modem. This can
operate at data rates of 14400, 12000, 9600 and 7200 bits/second. The audio
output is a stream of 16 bit samples, at 8000 samples/second. The transmit and
receive side of V.17 modems operate independantly. V.17 is mostly used for FAX
transmission, where it provides the standard 14400 bits/second rate.

\section v17tx_page_sec_2 How does it work?
V.17 uses QAM modulation and trellis coding. The data to be transmitted is
scrambled, to whiten it. The least significant 2 bits of each symbol are then
differentially encoded, using a simple lookup approach. The resulting 2 bits are
convolutionally encoded, producing 3 bits. The extra bit is the redundant bit
of the trellis code. The other bits of the symbol pass by the differential
and convolutional coding unchanged. The resulting bits define the constellation
point to be transmitted for the symbol. The redundant bit doubles the size of the
constellation, and so increases the error rate for detecting individual symbols
at the receiver. However, when a number of successive symbols are processed at
the receiver, the redundancy actually provides several dB of improved error
performance.

The standard method of producing a QAM modulated signal is to use a sampling
rate which is a multiple of the baud rate. The raw signal is then a series of
complex pulses, each an integer number of samples long. These can be shaped,
using a suitable complex filter, and multiplied by a complex carrier signal
to produce the final QAM signal for transmission.

The pulse shaping filter is only vaguely defined by the V.17 spec. Some of the
other ITU modem specs. fully define the filter, typically specifying a root
raised cosine filter, with 50% excess bandwidth. This is a pity, since it
increases the variability of the received signal. However, the receiver's
adaptive equalizer will compensate for these differences. The current
design uses a root raised cosine filter with 25% excess bandwidth. Greater
excess bandwidth will not allow the tranmitted signal to meet the spectral
requirements.

The sampling rate for our transmitter is defined by the channel - 8000 per
second. This is not a multiple of the baud rate (i.e. 2400 baud). The baud
interval is actually 10/3 sample periods. Instead of using a symmetric
FIR to pulse shape the signal, a polyphase filter is used. This consists of
10 sets of coefficients, offering zero to 9/10ths of a baud phase shift as well
as root raised cosine filtering. The appropriate coefficient set is chosen for
each signal sample generated.

The carrier is generated using the DDS method. Using two second order resonators,
started in quadrature, might be more efficient, as it would have less impact on
the processor cache than a table lookup approach. However, the DDS approach
suits the receiver better, so the same signal generator is also used for the
transmitter.
