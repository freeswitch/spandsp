/*! \page v27ter_rx_page The V.27ter receiver

\section v27ter_rx_page_sec_1 What does it do?
The V.27ter receiver implements the receive side of a V.27ter modem. This can operate
at data rates of 4800 and 2400 bits/s. The audio input is a stream of 16 bit samples,
at 8000 samples/second. The transmit and receive side of V.27ter modems operate
independantly. V.27ter is mostly used for FAX transmission, where it provides the
standard 4800 bits/s rate (the 2400 bits/s mode is not used for FAX).

\section v27ter_rx_page_sec_2 How does it work?
V.27ter defines two modes of operation. One uses 8-PSK at 1600 baud, giving 4800bps.
The other uses 4-PSK at 1200 baud, giving 2400bps. A training sequence is specified
at the start of transmission, which makes the design of a V.27ter receiver relatively
straightforward.
