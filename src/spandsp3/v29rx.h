/*! \page v29rx_page The V.29 receiver
\section v29rx_page_sec_1 What does it do?
The V.29 receiver implements the receive side of a V.29 modem. This can operate
at data rates of 9600, 7200 and 4800 bits/s. The audio input is a stream of 16
bit samples, at 8000 samples/second. The transmit and receive side of V.29
modems operate independantly. V.29 is mostly used for FAX transmission, where it
provides the standard 9600 and 7200 bits/s rates (the 4800 bits/s mode is not
used for FAX).

\section v29rx_page_sec_2 How does it work?
V.29 operates at 2400 baud for all three bit rates. It uses 16-QAM modulation for
9600bps, 8-QAM for 7200bps, and 4-PSK for 4800bps. A training sequence is specified
at the start of transmission, which makes the design of a V.29 receiver relatively
straightforward.

The first stage of the training sequence consists of 128
symbols, alternating between two constellation positions. The receiver monitors
the signal power, to sense the possible presence of a valid carrier. When the
alternating signal begins, the power rising above a minimum threshold (-26dBm0)
causes the main receiver computation to begin. The initial measured power is
used to quickly set the gain of the receiver. After this initial settling, the
front end gain is locked, and the adaptive equalizer tracks any subsequent
signal level variation. The signal is oversampled to 24000 samples/second (i.e.
signal, zero, zero, signal, zero, zero, ...) and fed to a complex root raised
cosine pulse shaping filter. This filter has been modified from the conventional
root raised cosine filter, by shifting it up the band, to be centred at the nominal
carrier frequency. This filter interpolates the samples, pulse shapes, and performs
a fractional sample delay at the same time. 48 sets of filter coefficients are used to
achieve a set of finely spaces fractional sample delays, between zero and
one sample. By choosing every fifth sample, and the appropriate set of filter
coefficients, the properly tuned symbol tracker can select data samples at 4800
samples/second from points within 1.125 degrees of the centre and mid-points of
each symbol. The output of the filter is multiplied by a complex carrier, generated
by a DDS. The result is a baseband signal, requiring no further filtering, apart from
an adaptive equalizer. The baseband signal is fed to a T/2 adaptive equalizer.
A band edge component maximisation algorithm is used to tune the sampling, so the samples
fed to the equalizer are close to the mid point and edges of each symbol. Initially
the algorithm is very lightly damped, to ensure the symbol alignment pulls in
quickly. Because the sampling rate will not be precisely the same as the
transmitter's (the spec. says the symbol timing should be within 0.01%), the
receiver constantly evaluates and corrects this sampling throughout its
operation. During the symbol timing maintainence phase, the algorithm uses
a heavier damping.

The carrier is specified as 1700Hz +-1Hz at the transmitter, and 1700 +-7Hz at
the receiver. The receive carrier would only be this inaccurate if the link
includes FDM sections. These are being phased out, but the design must still
allow for the worst case. Using an initial 1700Hz signal for demodulation gives
a worst case rotation rate for the constellation of about one degree per symbol.
Once the symbol timing synchronisation algorithm has been given time to lock to
the symbol timing of the initial alternating pattern, the phase of the demodulated
signal is recorded on two successive symbols - once for each of the constellation
positions. The receiver then tracks the symbol alternations, until a large phase jump
occurs. This signifies the start of the next phase of the training sequence. At this
point the total phase shift between the original recorded symbol phase, and the
symbol phase just before the phase jump occurred is used to provide a coarse
estimation of the rotation rate of the constellation, and it current absolute
angle of rotation. These are used to update the current carrier phase and phase
update rate in the carrier DDS. The working data already in the pulse shaping
filter and equalizer buffers is given a similar step rotation to pull it all
into line. From this point on, a heavily damped integrate and dump approach,
based on the angular difference between each received constellation position and
its expected position, is sufficient to track the carrier, and maintain phase
alignment. A fast rough approximator for the arc-tangent function is adequate
for the estimation of the angular error.

The next phase of the training sequence is a scrambled sequence of two
particular symbols. We train the T/2 adaptive equalizer using this sequence. The
scrambling makes the signal sufficiently diverse to ensure the equalizer
converges to the proper generalised solution. At the end of this sequence, the
equalizer should be sufficiently well adapted that is can correctly resolve the
full QAM constellation. However, the equalizer continues to adapt throughout
operation of the modem, fine tuning on the more complex data patterns of the
full QAM constellation.

In the last phase of the training sequence, the modem enters normal data
operation, with a short defined period of all ones as data. As in most high
speed modems, data in a V.29 modem passes through a scrambler, to whiten the
spectrum of the signal. The transmitter should initialise its data scrambler,
and pass the ones through it. At the end of the ones, real data begins to pass
through the scrambler, and the transmit modem is in normal operation. The
receiver tests that ones are really received, in order to verify the modem
trained correctly. If all is well, the data following the ones is fed to the
application, and the receive modem is up and running. Unfortunately, some
transmit side of some real V.29 modems fail to initialise their scrambler before
sending the ones. This means the first 23 received bits (the length of the
scrambler register) cannot be trusted for the test. The receive modem,
therefore, only tests that bits starting at bit 24 are really ones.
