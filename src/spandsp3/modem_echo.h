/*! \page modem_echo_can_page Line echo cancellation for modems

\section modem_echo_can_page_sec_1 What does it do?
This module aims to cancel electrical echoes (e.g. from 2-4 wire hybrids)
in modem applications. It is not very suitable for speech applications, which
require additional refinements for satisfactory performance. It is, however, more
efficient and better suited to modem applications.

\section modem_echo_can_page_sec_2 How does it work?
The heart of the echo cancellor is an adaptive FIR filter. This is adapted to
match the impulse response of the environment being cancelled. It must be long
enough to adequately cover the duration of that impulse response. The signal
being transmitted into the environment being cancelled is passed through the
FIR filter. The resulting output is an estimate of the echo signal. This is
then subtracted from the received signal, and the result should be an estimate
of the signal which originates within the environment being cancelled (people
talking in the room, or the signal from the far end of a telephone line) free
from the echos of our own transmitted signal.

The FIR filter is adapted using the least mean squares (LMS) algorithm. This
algorithm is attributed to Widrow and Hoff, and was introduced in 1960. It is
the commonest form of filter adaption used in things like modem line equalisers
and line echo cancellers. It works very well if the signal level is constant,
which is true for a modem signal. To ensure good performa certain conditions must
be met:

    - The transmitted signal has weak self-correlation.
    - There is no signal being generated within the environment being cancelled.

The difficulty is that neither of these can be guaranteed. If the adaption is
performed while transmitting noise (or something fairly noise like, such as
voice) the adaption works very well. If the adaption is performed while
transmitting something highly correlative (e.g. tones, like DTMF), the adaption
can go seriously wrong. The reason is there is only one solution for the
adaption on a near random signal. For a repetitive signal, there are a number of
solutions which converge the adaption, and nothing guides the adaption to choose
the correct one.

\section modem_echo_can_page_sec_3 How do I use it?
The echo cancellor processes both the transmit and receive streams sample by
sample. The processing function is not declared inline. Unfortunately,
cancellation requires many operations per sample, so the call overhead is only a
minor burden.
